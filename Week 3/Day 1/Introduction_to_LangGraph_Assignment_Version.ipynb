        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

              "\n",
              "1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\n",
              "\n",
              "2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input query. This means that the information from the retrieved documents is combined with the original query to provide more context and relevant information.\n",
              "\n",
              "3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as GPT-3 or BERT, uses the augmented input to generate a response. The generative model can produce more accurate and contextually relevant answers because it has access to additional information retrieved in the first step.\n",
              "\n",
              "RAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the input query is complex or requires specific knowledge that may not be fully captured by the generative model alone. By leveraging external information sources, RAG can enhance the quality and relevance of the generated responses."

              "   'output': \"In Python, you can store key-value pairs using dictionaries. A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique. Here is a basic example of how to create and use a dictionary in Python:\\n\\n### Creating a Dictionary\\nYou can create a dictionary by placing a comma-separated sequence of key-value pairs within curly braces `{}`. Each key is separated from its value by a colon `:`.\\n\\n```python\\n# Creating a dictionary\\nmy_dict = {\\n    'name': 'Alice',\\n    'age': 25,\\n    'city': 'New York'\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Accessing Values\\nYou can access the value associated with a specific key by using square brackets `[]`.\\n\\n```python\\n# Accessing values\\nprint(my_dict['name'])  # Output: Alice\\nprint(my_dict['age'])   # Output: 25\\n```\\n\\n### Adding or Updating Key-Value Pairs\\nYou can add a new key-value pair or update an existing key-value pair by using the assignment operator `=`.\\n\\n```python\\n# Adding a new key-value pair\\nmy_dict['email'] = 'alice@example.com'\\n\\n# Updating an existing key-value pair\\nmy_dict['age'] = 26\\n```\\n\\n### Removing Key-Value Pairs\\nYou can remove a key-value pair using the `del` statement or the `pop` method.\\n\\n```python\\n# Using del statement\\ndel my_dict['city']\\n\\n# Using pop method\\nemail = my_dict.pop('email')\\n```\\n\\n### Iterating Over a Dictionary\\nYou can iterate over the keys, values, or key-value pairs in a dictionary using a `for` loop.\\n\\n```python\\n# Iterating over keys\\nfor key in my_dict:\\n    print(key)\\n\\n# Iterating over values\\nfor value in my_dict.values():\\n    print(value)\\n\\n# Iterating over key-value pairs\\nfor key, value in my_dict.items():\\n    print(f'{key}: {value}')\\n```\\n\\n### Checking if a Key Exists\\nYou can check if a key exists in a dictionary using the `in` keyword.\\n\\n```python\\nif 'name' in my_dict:\\n    print('Name is a key in the dictionary')\\n```\\n\\n### Dictionary Methods\\nDictionaries come with several useful methods, such as `get`, `keys`, `values`, `items`, `update`, and `clear`.\\n\\n```python\\n# Using get method\\nname = my_dict.get('name', 'Default Name')\\n\\n# Using keys method\\nkeys = my_dict.keys()\\n\\n# Using values method\\nvalues = my_dict.values()\\n\\n# Using items method\\nitems = my_dict.items()\\n\\n# Using update method\\nmy_dict.update({'country': 'USA'})\\n\\n# Using clear method\\nmy_dict.clear()\\n```\\n\\nThese are some of the basic operations you can perform with dictionaries in Python to store and manage key-value pairs.\",\n",

Here are some key capabilities that agents can add:\\n\\n1. **Task Automation**:\\n   - Agents can automate repetitive and mundane tasks, freeing up human resources for more complex activities.\\n   - They can handle tasks such as scheduling, data entry, and basic customer service inquiries.\\n\\n2. **Contextual Understanding**:\\n   - Agents can maintain context over longer interactions, allowing for more coherent and relevant responses.\\n   - They can track user preferences and history to provide personalized experiences.\\n\\n3. **Multi-step Reasoning**:\\n   - Agents can break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps and execute them in sequence.\\n   - They can handle multi-turn conversations and follow through on user requests that require multiple actions.\\n\\n4. **Integration with External Systems**:\\n   - Agents can interact with various APIs and external systems to fetch or update information.\\n   - They can integrate with databases, CRM systems, and other enterprise software to provide real-time data and insights.\\n\\n5. **Decision Making**:\\n   - Agents can make decisions based on predefined rules or learned patterns.\\n   - They can evaluate different options and choose the best course of action based on the given criteria.\\n\\n6. **Natural Language Understanding and Generation**:\\n   - Agents can understand and generate human-like text, making interactions more natural and intuitive.\\n   - They can handle a wide range of languages and dialects, broadening their usability.\\n\\n7. **Learning and Adaptation**:\\n   - Agents can learn from interactions and improve over time.\\n   - They can adapt to new information and changing environments, becoming more effective with continued use.\\n\\n8. **Error Handling and Recovery**:\\n   - Agents can detect errors or misunderstandings in interactions and take corrective actions.\\n   - They can ask clarifying questions or provide alternative solutions to ensure user satisfaction.\\n\\n9. **Scalability**:\\n   - Agents can handle multiple interactions simultaneously, making them scalable solutions for high-demand environments.\\n   - They can be deployed across various platforms and devices, ensuring consistent user experiences.\\n\\n10. **Enhanced User Experience**:\\n    - Agents can provide instant responses and 24/7 availability, improving user satisfaction.\\n    - They can offer interactive and engaging experiences, such as virtual assistants, chatbots, and interactive voice response systems.\\n\\nBy incorporating these capabilities, agents can significantly enhance the functionality and user experience of LLM-based applications, making them more powerful and versatile tools for a wide range of use cases.',\n",

The intrinsic rank concept is key to this balance, ensuring that the essence of the model's learning capability is preserved with significantly ... Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely-used parameter-efficient finetuning method for large language models. LoRA saves memory by training only low rank perturbations to selected weight matrices.

Understand the steps and components of attention mechanism architecture and see examples of its applications. The Transformer, since then, has become a popular architecture choice for a variety of tasks. It is capable of capturing long-range dependencies in data making it a powerful tool not only for NLP but also for computer vision, audio, and protein folding. Transformer: the all-powerful in the land of machine learning. Attention mechanism is a fundamental invention in artificial intelligence and machine learning, redefining the capabilities of deep learning models. This mechanism, inspired by the human mental process of selective focus, has emerged as a pillar in a variety of applications, accelerating developments in natural language processing, computer vision, and beyond. In the ever-evolving field of deep learning, one concept that has garnered significant attention (pun intended) is the Attention Mechanism. This ingenious concept has revolutionized the way neural… The introduction of the Transformer model was a significant leap forward for the concept of attention in deep learning.
